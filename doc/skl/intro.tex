\chap{Introduction}

The virtual \ac{CPU} presented in this manual has been greatly
influenced by the \mips and \natsemi architectures, and while it's not
a clone of either, many ideas have been liberally borrowed.  It is a
little-endian \ac{CPU} that is small enough for one person to
understand fully.

The \ac{CPU} has also been designed to support the implementation of a
compiler and full runtime system for the Oberon-2 programming
language.  As a result, there are special instructions which support
code generation and runtime characteristics of that language.

While many of the advanced features of the \mips architecture, such as
caches and memory management, have been left out of this
implementation, the design of this \ac{CPU} has been carefully
undertaken so that the ambitious soul will be able to add them in
without changing the semantics of the \ac{CPU}.
