\section{Introduction}\label{memlay}

This document serves as a reference for the data structures emitted by
the compiler, and the runtime stack- and heap-based data structures
used by the \gc.

The data structures generated by the compiler are used by the memory
allocator and \gc to follow pointers when marking reachable data
stored on the heap.  The heap-based data structures allow the \gc to
determine the status of any allocated block on the heap (i.e., free or
used).

Note that in the following sections, the variable \emph{n} is used
generically to denote the number of dimensions of an array.
